# Hillside 56 Ergonomic Keyboard

Despite being the second board developed,
  wrapping up the 56 documentation has taken a back seat 
  to the more interesting splayed 52,
  which developed as a more compact version of the same ideas.

In the meantime, Hillside 56:

- KiCad files are on the \_56 [branch](https://github.com/mmccoyd/hillside/tree/_56/hillside56) in this repository
- QMK firmware is on the \_hill56 branch in my [QMK fork](https://github.com/mmccoyd/qmk_firmware/tree/_hill56).

It has been in use by me,
  just not wrapped up nicely for release yet. 
I have no expectation of it needing substantive changes. 
But I am likely to do a git rebase as part of my final cleanup and doc  files, so any development, beyond a keymap, based off it is at risk of git pain.
The branches are named \_foo as a hint of being volatile. 

To edit a keymap more easily than in a text file,
  the [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/sofle/rev1/LAYOUT) 
  can be used with the Sofle keyboard selection.
They have the same pin layout,
  so the Solfe keyboard 
  can be used to create keymap layers and generate firmware.
